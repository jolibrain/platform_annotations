Visit Annotation Tool home and click on New Project : This New Project form appears: Fill the details, and select the connection you've created before as Source and Target connection: Tag Editor When the project has been created, the Tag Editor tab will be available, with images from the connection Now you must create new Tags in the tag section of the page, click on the \"+\" icon: Here is an example of created tags: You can now tag each image from the Tag Editor. The workflow is optimised for fast keyboard manipulation: press key \"F\" to add a rectangle on the full image press the tag shortcut number to apply a tab on this rectangle.

You can navigate to your connection data path: You'll find a new \" train \" folder: Inside this train folder, you will find a folder for each tag, containing the images you've tagged from the Tag Editor.
